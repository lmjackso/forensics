/**export**/

export_metadata(metadata, newname)
	This function takes in two objects, metadata, which is a metadata map, like the object returned from parse_map_from_directory and newname, which is the new path+name of the excel file to be written.

/**parser**/

get_file_size(filename)
	This function returns the numeric size of the file specified by filename, which should include the absolute path of the file.

metadata_map(filename)
	This function extracts the metadata map of Data elements used by hachoir with an input of filename, which corresponds to an absolute path of a file.

get_value(metadata_value):
	This function takes a metadata data object and returns its value.

get_text(metadata_value):
	This function takes a metadata data object and returns the text description of it.

create_list(metadata_map):
	This function takes a metadata map like the one generated by metadata_map(filename) and generates a list of elements formatted like this [<key>, <value>].

list_to_parse(rootdir):
	This function takes the absolute path of the directory at the root of the files you want to parse.  This then returns an array of full file names to be processed.

get_extension(filename):
	This function returns the file extension contained within the filename.

name_extension_tuple(filename):
	This function takes in a file name and outputs a two element list, one being the filename including the extension and the second being the extension.

tuple_list(list):
	This function applies name_extension_tuple to a list of file names, rather than just one.

metadata_for_filelike(filelike):
	This function attempts to retrieve a metadata map from a file whose type is not known.  It's input is a file name or I/O stream and it's output is a metadata map.

parse_map_from_directory(directory):
	This function takes a directory, and parses every file inside of it for metadata.  It then constructs a map of filenames to their corresponding metadata maps.  This map of filenames to the corresponding typed metadata maps is what this function returns.  The map of metadata maps between description of the field and the value of the field, which is originally in a Data object.  In order to retrieve the value in as a native python object, use the function get_value, provided.  

	i.e.
	directory = "User/lmjackso/Private/Test"
	filename = "User/lmjackso/Private/Test/test.png"

	get_value(parse_map_from_directory(directory)[filename]['width'])
	>> some number of pixels, i.e. 1920

/**helper**/
filter_map_by_extension(extension,metadatamap)
	This function takes in a map like the one parsed from parse_map_from_directory(directory) and a file extension, and returns a filtered map that only contains files of the type specified by the file extension input.
